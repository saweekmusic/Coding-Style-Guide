# Coding-Style-Guide
Welcome to my personal Python style guide — a set of consistent rules and best practices tailored for me, designed to keep my code clean, readable, and ADHD-friendly. 

Here you can find the style guides that I am using (or planning on using) in my (upcoming) projects. If you want to understand better my code and _how_ I write code, this is for you.

This guide is a living document: I’ll update it as I learn and grow. It combines ideas from established conventions (like Google’s style), but mostly it reflects what helps me write better code, faster.
